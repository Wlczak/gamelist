# Gamelist instalation guide

1. Clone repo and set correct branche
2. Put into the folder of your webserver with a php 8.0 or newer
3. If you don't have composer installed install it for [Windows](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe) [Linux](https://getcomposer.org/download/) and run `composer install` in the root folder of this repo
4. It should now run on <http://localhost/gamelist>.

If it doesn't work try checking your webserver settings at [slim webserver docs](https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v4/start/web-servers.html)
